DO NOT INTERACT
Ã— RACISTS, HOMOPHOBES/TRANSPHOBES, SEXISTS, ECTâ€¦.. Stay away from me.
Ã— ANTI-FURRIES, ANTITHERIANS OR ANTIALTERHUMANS - Donâ€™t like people having fun expressing themselves? Get out.
Ã— PROSHIPPERS/ AGRESSIVE SHIPPERS - Iâ€™m rarely a fan of shipping even more in some fandoms. Though I do have a little few rare pairs for some. Sure some are cute and you can totally continue your shipping freely but just donâ€™t make a fuss if I donâ€™t agree with it.
Ã— TROLLS - Yâ€™all just arenâ€™t funny most of the timeâ€¦
Ã— NO RELIGION FORCING - I donâ€™t care what you believe in or what you are but just donâ€™t force it onto me. Everyone have their own beliefs and respect that.
