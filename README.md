Neurodivergent queer system and alterhuman [ask if curious!] Rotting dancing corpse not scared to bite

Don't request until we've talked a bit [Tonetags/emotes prefferred to talk, thanks for being patient with me!]

DO NOT COVER, COPY OR CUDDLE! - Cuddles are okay as long as there’s C+H in my name. I can accept to be covered from GOOD friends. Taking inspo from my skins is okay, but do not copy or post without having my permission.

DO NOT INTERACT

× RACISTS, HOMOPHOBES/TRANSPHOBES, SEXISTS, ECT….. Stay away from me.

× ANTI-FURRIES, ANTITHERIANS OR ANTIALTERHUMANS - Don’t like people having fun expressing themselves? Get out.

× TROLLS - Y’all just aren’t funny most of the time…

× NO RELIGION FORCING - I don’t care what you believe in or what you are but just don’t force it onto me. Everyone have their own beliefs and respect that.
